    <h2>About Jaylee Sorenson</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Jaylee Sorenson -- a writer passionate about storytelling, character journeys, and the small moments that make life feel real.
      <br>
      While I explore many form of writing, including poetry and nonfiction, my heart belons to fiction and novels.
      I've been writing for as long as I can remember, driven by a love of words and the way stories can connect us.
      <br>
      My work has been featured in <i>The Southern Quill</i> and on <i>Route 7 Review</i>, and I continue to grow and refine
      my craft as I move toward my dream of becoming a published novelist.
      Whether I'm writing a sweeping adventure, a quiet reflection, or a sharp review, my goal is always the same:
      to create something that resonates with leaders.
      <br>
      When I'm not lost in a draft or dreaming up new stories, you can find me on sharing glimpses of my writing journey on my 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaylee.sorenson/">instagram</a> or outside participating in one of my many hobbies.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for being part of this adventure with me.
    </p>
